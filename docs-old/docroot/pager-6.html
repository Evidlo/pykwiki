<p>PyKwiki is fast because it's 100% static. No server side processing is necessary. Why regenerate a page every single time someone visits it? PyKwiki regenerates the page only when its content has changed. </p>
<p><em>But wait! How can that be if you have built-in searching?</em> PyKwiki generates a JSON index file for page searches, so unlike most other static content systems, you don't need to rely on a third party to perform searches. </p>
<h2 id="optimizing-pykwiki">Optimizing PyKwiki</h2>
<p>In most cases, PyKwiki won't require any optimization. However, if a PyKwiki site happens to receive hundreds of thousands of views per day, then there are a few different techniques to help remove this load.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Nginx or Apache Workers MPM. <ul>
<li>This alone can greatly increase page performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cache content.<ul>
<li>Tell your webserver to cache content in the user's browser for a few hours. They won't see updates when they're released, but this can dramatically reduce server load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a CDN.<ul>
<li>Use something like <a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloud Flare</a> to cache your content on a CDN. This can be the most expensive option, but it works well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
